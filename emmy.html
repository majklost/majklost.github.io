    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 18.12.2024</em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use
      our Google Chrome extension Emmy Extension, further referred as "The
      Extension".
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Our Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or
      sensitive user data. The Extension is designed to operate without
      requiring any personal information from users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Access to Google Drive</h2>
    <p>
      The Extension requires access to your Google Drive for the sole purpose
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating and managing files specifically generated by the Extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading, modifying, or deleting files created by the Extension itself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension does <strong>not</strong> access, read, or modify any other
      files in your Google Drive. Access is granted via the
      <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code> scope and complies
      with Google's API Services User Data Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Consent and Revocation</h2>
