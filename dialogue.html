    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 06.05.2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use
      our Google Chrome extension, <strong>Emmy Dialogue AI</strong>, referred
      to as “the Extension”.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Extension does not collect, store, or retain any personal or sensitive
      user data. It is designed to ensure your privacy by not associating any
      data with individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Audio Processing and Use of Microsoft Azure</h2>
    <p>
      The Extension allows users to record their voice, which is then
      temporarily sent to a secure server for the
      <strong>sole purpose</strong> of converting speech to text using Microsoft
      Azure’s Speech-to-Text API.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The server <strong>does not store</strong> any recordings or
        transcripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Audio data is processed <strong>transiently and securely</strong>, then
        discarded immediately after receiving a response from Azure.
      </li>
      <li>
        No personal identifiers or metadata are stored or linked to recordings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Extension, you consent to the temporary processing of your
      audio recordings for speech-to-text conversion via Microsoft Azure.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Extension is not intended for individuals under the age of 16. We do
      not knowingly collect or process any information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Compliance with GDPR</h2>
    <p>
      Our operations are based in Europe, specifically in the Czech Republic.
      While no personal data is collected or stored, we respect the principles
      of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including:

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You may stop using the
        Extension at any time. As the Extension does not store data, no further
        action is required for data deletion.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
